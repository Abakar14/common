**HTTP status codes** are standard response codes given by web servers when handling requests from clients. Each status code serves a specific purpose and provides information about the result of the request. They are grouped into different categories based on the range of numbers they fall into. Below are the **most common HTTP status codes** grouped by category:

### 1. **Informational Responses (100-199)**

- **100 Continue**: The client should continue with its request after the initial part has been sent, typically used in a two-part request.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.

### 2. **Successful Responses (200-299)**

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server responded with the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created (typically used for POST requests).
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
- **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request, but no content is returned (often used for DELETE operations).

### 3. **Redirection Messages (300-399)**

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been moved permanently to a new URL.
- **302 Found** (or **Temporarily Moved**): The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request (often used with caching).

### 4. **Client Error Responses (400-499)**

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has either failed or not been provided.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: The request method (e.g., GET, POST) is not supported for the resource.
- **409 Conflict**: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource (e.g., attempting to create a resource that already exists).
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The server understands the request, but it is unable to process the contained instructions (typically used for validation errors).

### 5. **Server Error Responses (500-599)**

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message when the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unavailable (e.g., overloaded or down for maintenance).
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server, acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

### Summary of Most Common HTTP Status Codes

- **200 OK**: Success.
- **201 Created**: Resource created.
- **204 No Content**: Success, no content to return.
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required.
- **403 Forbidden**: Access not allowed.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found.
- **409 Conflict**: Resource conflict.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server error.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server temporarily unavailable.

These status codes help communicate the outcome of HTTP requests and inform the client what kind of action is required or what happened during the request. Understanding and correctly using these codes is crucial for building RESTful APIs and web services.
